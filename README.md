# Titanic Survival Probability Machine Learning

This project involves developing a machine learning model to estimate the survival probability of a person in today's context if they were to board the Titanic, using data from individuals who were on the Titanic during the disaster.

## Project Description

This study aims to provide an interesting perspective by using data science and machine learning techniques to transpose a historical event into the present. The project utilizes a dataset containing personal and travel information of passengers on the Titanic to create a classification model.

## Dataset

The project works with the [Titanic dataset](link_to_dataset). This dataset includes various features such as age, gender, class, and the number of family members for each passenger. Additionally, there is label data indicating whether a passenger survived or was lost.

## Technologies and Algorithms Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Other used libraries]

Various algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, or deep learning have been employed to create the machine learning model.
